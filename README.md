# nx/nest/next playground

This is a project for the purpose of 'trying out' various things. It's a collection of small PoCs and so isn't a showcase of 'production-hardened' code or even normal development practices.

In putting it together, my focus has been quite narrow and I've deliberately not focussed on things outside of that focus.

## In scope

- nx monorepo
- next FE application
- Graphql backend
- toying with various page/query caching mechanisms
- microservices built with nestjs
- RabbitMq exchanges/queues of various patterns (competing consumer, pub/sub, rpc)
- little play with BullMQ
- virtual table using tanstack's react-table and react-virtual libraries
- infinite scroll
- Postgres/PrismORM
- websockets
- kubernetes deployment
- securing front-end and backend with clerk
- building bespoke nx executors for docker build and kubernetes deployment

## Out of scope

- unit testing - these are just rapidly prototyped, throwaway PoCs
- e2e testing
- CI/CD deployment
- UI design
